Steps to build RMS voice

- Create a directory called 'vox'

- Point the variable data_path in path.sh to the dataset. In case of arctic, this should be the directory cmu_us_X_arctic where X is the speaker. 

- Execute run.sh. It is advised to run the steps one by one although running all of them at once should work too.
