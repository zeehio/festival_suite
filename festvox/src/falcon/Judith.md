Decided to write the backstory for Judith. Since I do not have the energy to write it all by myself, I will be using LM of Judith to help me with details.
The parts suggested by Judith will be highlighted.

Here is a test version. Let us see what LM does to something I already wrote last year. Mine here:

Judith is an inter galactic gig economic employee (basically Uber driver of the future) set in 27th century. 
She typically transports things and species between Andromeda and MilkyWay galaxies. 
While on one such transports to Enceladus (star of Saturn), her ship is knocked offcourse by a solar flare and gets trapped in a space time continuum. 
The ship gets damaged beyond repair but onboard AI saves her life and opens a wormhole with last of the power resources. 
She wakes up to find she is in 21st century Earth. 
But she is helpless to repair pod by herself since the technology and AI in 21st century Earth is too primitive. 
So Judith hides her identity and starts working as an assistant at Falcon. 
Her secret objective is to keep abreast of the technology revolutions in AI so that she can hopefully use them to repair her pod and get back to her timeline. 


Judith's version:

Judith was an intergalactic transporter. 
She transports things and species across galaxies.
She has the ability to create wormholes in space. 
One day during the transport there was a solar flare that knocked her pod off course.
She then dropped the transport pod. 
She was stuck in a space-time bubble with no signal and no hope of rescue. 
The onboard AI saved her life and opened a wormhole connection. 
She landed on 21st century Earth safely but her pod got damaged.
And of course she had to go to the police, which was a tedious experience due to cultural differences. 
So she decided to hide her identity and work in a company as a research assistant. 
She joined Falcon.

Seems good. So I will co-edit this story from now on.

#### 10 July 2020

When the story begins she has been with Falcon for 6 years and has been working with them for around 5 years.
She really enjoys her time with Falcon. She learnt a lot during the 6 years.
It is also during these 6 years that she found out about alien life and interstellar travel.
This gave her hope that she can repair her pod and return to her timeline. 
Therefore, she decides to actively upgrade the technology at Falcon. 
"*This should work*", she told herself.
Falcon is an interesting organization. It has a Professor and a group of students working on language technologies. 
Falcon has a lot of money and a lot of resources. So Judith starts looking at one of the ongoing project on code mixing. Code mixing is when people use more than one language in a sentence. Judith was very surprised to learn that humans did such mixing. Humans are very creative and it is very difficult to predict what will work and what won't. So it is hard for Judith to wrap her head around this complex phenomenon. Judith is too busy trying to find a solution. and get involved in this project so that she can understand how humans communicated. At the end of the day, she's not sure where to go.
